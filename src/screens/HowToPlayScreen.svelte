    <h3>How to keep social distance</h3>

    <p>
      You're trying to stay socialy distant, but all around you are these people who just don't care. Look at them,
      they're not even wearing a mask... üôÑ
      <br />
      They're irresponsible and deserve a solid smack!
    </p>

    <p>Use arrow keys to throw punches at them. If you're on mobile, touch the area around your avatar.</p>

    <p>
      <span>{randomStranger}</span>
      Strangers: Smack 'em right in the face!
      <br />
      <span>{randomFriend}</span>
      Loved ones: Hug them (DON'T punch them!)
      <br />
      <span>{projectileTypes.Life.emoji}</span>
      Heart: Grab it for an extra life (or punch it for extra points)
      <br />
      <span>{projectileTypes.Shield.emoji}</span>
      Shield: Gives you protection from strangers (or points if you punch it)
    </p>

    <p>Once you lost all your lives, the game's over ‚ò†Ô∏è</p>

    <p>Keep an eye at your stamina, don't wave your fist to much or you'll get exhausted!</p>
